# Shopping Server

## Description

The goal for this project was to create the back-end for an e-commerce website. Through Node.js and MySQL2, it connects to a MySQL server with product, category and tag information and serves that depending on the routes hit by the user.

In the future, I'd like to add front-end functionality to this to make it a fully functional e-commerce site rather than only the back-end side of it.
